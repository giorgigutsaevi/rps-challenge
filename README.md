# Task

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## How does it work?
 - The user submits their name
 - Player chooses Rock, Paper or Scissors
 - Player sees the result of their game
 - Player is given option to play again or end gaim
